Additional inline variables char array variables are included to be called when the user interacts 
the portal to make it user friendly. After completion of the process the user is given a final 
acknowledgement mesage about his ticket being booked. Changes that can be applied: A validation 
of the literals may be added to ensure proper input at the proper entries in this function. A card 
saver might be added so that user's card/net banking details may be stored in the database to 
facilitate quick transactions. 
 
Color changer

Small code to faciliate color change and clearscreen in two different distributions. (Win/Linux)
Defined a _COLOR_H macro to ensure the functions are not being formed multiple times.

color_change(int k) - return type void
Changes color of the next text being written. (REFER LIST IN COLOR_CHANGER.C FOR K VALUES)
This should work in Linux/Windows environment.
